# Graduation Project
WGU BS Comp Sci final project

This Project uses a data set taken form the following link on Kaggle.com
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fronkongames/steam-games-dataset

The project attempts to make predictions about video game sales using a game age derived from the release dateof a game as well as game genres. Due to a lack of historical data the predictions are quite varied. However the framework for predictions is set in place.

The graphs at the bottom of the GUI help describe the data set used and explain the sets shortcomings.

The following link is to a working version of the streamlit GUI.
